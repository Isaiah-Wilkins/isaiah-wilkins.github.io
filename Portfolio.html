    <p style="font-size: 25px";> Welcome to my portfolio!<br> over the year Ill be adding to this page to document projects and assignments, This will make it so that I can see the difference between my earlier works and my improvments Ive made along the way that also means that this entire website itself will grow, expand, and upgrade so it wont be as trashy. Im aware that in its current state it is lacking quite a bit but I aim to improve that fact and make it less bland. In the meantime theres a simple flappy bird type game on the next page, Enjoy!</p>
